This directory, code-gen-server, contains code files that are used to handle code completion, file upload, and search requests. The code files contain functions that check the session of the user making the request, extract data from the request body, create a classifier, handle the file upload, search, or create messages with users. If there is an error, the code files will log the error and return a response of status code 500 with an error message.

// Use pure functions: A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input, without any side effects. Pure functions are easier to reason about, test, and compose, making your code more functional and modular.

// Use function composition: Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Function composition can simplify complex code by breaking it down into smaller, reusable functions.

// Use immutability: Immutable data is data that cannot be changed after it is created. Immutable data makes your code more predictable and easier to reason about because you can be sure that the data will not change unexpectedly.

// Use type inference: TypeScript has excellent type inference capabilities that can help you write more concise and expressive code. You can leverage TypeScript's type inference by using type aliases, type intersections, and type unions to create more precise and reusable types.

// Use functional programming libraries: Functional programming libraries like Ramda, lodash/fp, and RxJS can help you write more functional and declarative code. These libraries provide many useful functions and utilities for working with functional programming concepts like currying, composition, and immutability.

// Use algebraic data types: Algebraic data types like enums, unions, and interfaces can help you represent complex data structures in a more type-safe and expressive way. Algebraic data types can make your code more modular, reusable, and easier to reason about.

// Use type guards: Type guards are functions that check the type of a value at runtime and return a boolean value that TypeScript can use to narrow the type of the value. Type guards can help you write more type-safe code and avoid runtime errors.
